# 0x04. TypeScript

## Project Overview

This project focuses on learning the fundamentals of TypeScript, a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It provides a more reliable way of developing large-scale applications by adding type definitions.

## Resources

Here are some useful resources to guide you through the project:

- [TypeScript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Basic Types in TypeScript
   - Understand the common types in TypeScript, such as `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`, and `void`.
      - Learn how TypeScript ensures type safety during development.

### 2. Interfaces, Classes, and Functions
   - Learn how to define and implement **interfaces** in TypeScript.
      - Understand how **classes** and **constructors** work.
         - Explore how TypeScript can improve function definitions with type annotations.

### 3. Working with the DOM and TypeScript
   - Learn how TypeScript can interact with DOM elements.
      - Understand the typing involved when manipulating the DOM with TypeScript.

### 4. Generic Types
   - Discover how to use **generics** to create flexible and reusable components in TypeScript.

### 5. Using Namespaces
   - Understand how **namespaces** are used to organize and encapsulate code.

### 6. Merging Declarations
   - Learn how TypeScript allows **declaration merging**, making it easier to extend or merge types across multiple files.

### 7. Using Ambient Namespaces to Import External Libraries
   - Understand how to declare and import external libraries using **ambient namespaces**.

### 8. Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript
   - Get familiar with **nominal typing**, a typing system based on the explicit declaration of types.
